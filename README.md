# Voron QD Panel Mod
A quick-detach panel mod for Voron 2 and Trident. This mod has a large number of components designed to work together, but can also be used selectively based on personal preference:  
- Quick Latch - based on github user [richardjm's](https://github.com/richardjm) excellent [snap latch](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/richardjm/snap-latch-2020) mod. The part has been modified to use M1.6 and M2 screws as hinges (kudos to richard for the the amazing parametric fusion360 design!). 
- Static bottom brackets - these are based on the stock voron brackets, but modified so the panels can be easily removed and inserted when the latches are opened.
- Corner safety brackets - these are for the top corners of the panels, they provide a tiny bit of seal while protecting the corners of the panels. they also add a bit of aesthetic flair. 
- Tool holder - this toolholder provides quick access to common tools (provided in LDO kits) you need to maintain your Voron. It is also quick detatachable.
- Screw Hinge - this is adds QD functionality to the front doors.

## Latch BOM
The following is the list of screws used for each latch. 
- M1.6x8 FHCS, 2 per latch.
- M2x45 SHCS, 1 per latch.
- M2x3x3.5 Threaded Brass insert, 1 per latch.
